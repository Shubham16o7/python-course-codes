#variables in python

#if 5>3#:
    #print("hello world") # if the space is not under the condition it will show intendtio#n error

#
#x=5
#y="john"    (For declaring variable in python we use only simple tags to fing it not more complicated#

###print(x)
#p#rint(y)

#x=str(5)
#y=int(5#)
#z=float(#5)

#print(x)    (so the output will get is 5-string 5-int 5.0-float)
##pr#int(y)    this is used to declare string
##p#rint(z)

#a=4
#A=5            #as python is case sensitive language it will not print 'a' and 'A' same
##print(a)
##print(A)

#variable can start with _ or small letter but it will not start with no. like 1 but it will contain numbers

#example
#a_c=4

#a = "apple"
#b = "ball"
#c = "c#at"

#print (a,b,c)


#you can also give multiple variables same content
#example
 
#x=y=z= "oranges" this is string
#print(x)
##print(y)
#print(z)

#x = "hello world"     (Array to find the place of word)
#print(x[4]) 
# = 0  because the place starts with 0,1,2,3,.... 

#x = "hello world!!" for rrunning code letter by letter below each alphabets (to loop through each character)

#for a in x:
#     print(a)

#x = "hello world"
#print (len(x)) {to find out length of string}


#x = "hello from the world"
#print ("the" in x)   { to find that word is present or not } also it gives boolean value like true and false


#x = "hello world"
#print (x[2:5]){to print specific value from 2nd word to 5th}

# we can also replace it by :5 to print value from starting till 5th place


#x= "hello world"
#print(x.upper())   {to print in upper case or lower case}

#x= "hello world     "
#print(x.strip())   {to remove space barfrom string}

#x= "hello world"
#print(x.replace("h", "y"))  {this is use to replace word}



#x = "hello world"
#print (x.split(","))      { to split word we use this}



#a = "hello"
#b = "world"

#print (a+" "+b) to add word in space between them
